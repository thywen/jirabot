# p7bot

p7bot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running p7bot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start p7bot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    p7-infobot>

Then you can interact with p7-infobot by typing `p7-infobot help`.

    p7-infobot> p7-infobot help
    p7-infobot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    p7-infobot help - Displays all of the help commands that p7-infobot knows about.
    ...

HUBOT_JIRA_PREFIX = The url of the jira instance
